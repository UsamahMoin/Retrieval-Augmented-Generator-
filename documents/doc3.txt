Climate change refers to significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns over time. While climate change is a natural phenomenon, human activities have accelerated the process. The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial activities release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, leading to global warming. The consequences of climate change include more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, and disruptions to ecosystems. Addressing climate change requires a collective effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adopt sustainable practices.
